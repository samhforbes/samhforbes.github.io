## Research Interests
* Developmental Psychology
* Visual Working Memory
* Psycholinguistics
* Language Learning
* Perception

I am a developmental psychologist who examines infant cognition using a variety of tools, including eye-tracking, neuroimaging, wearables and questionnaires.

My current project (with John Spencer) looks at the development of Visual Working Memory in infants - more details are available on the Developmental Dynamics lab web pages.

My DPhil was about looking at how infants learn colour words,
and how they associate those to the colours they see in the world around them.
