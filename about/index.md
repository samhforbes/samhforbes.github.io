<center>Senior (Postdoctoral) Research Associate at the University of East Anglia</center>

## Research Interests
* Developmental Psychology
* Visual Working Memory
* Psycholinguistics
* Language Learning
* Perception

My current project (with John Spencer) looks at the development of Visual Working Memory.
My DPhil was about looking at how infants learn colour words,
and how they associate those to the world they see around them.
